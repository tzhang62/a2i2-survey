          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            We invite you to take part in a research study. Please take as much time as you need to 
            read the consent form. You may want to discuss it with your family, friends, or your 
            personal doctor. If you find any of the language difficult to understand, please ask 
            questions. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form. A copy of the 
            signed form will be given to you for your records.

          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this study is to understand how artificial intelligence systems can 
            simulate individuals' decision-making and communication in stressful emergency 
            situations like fire rescues. We hope to learn how individual factors, such as personality 
            traits, moral values, and personal circumstances, affect how people respond to emergency 
            instructions and persuasion strategies. You are invited to participate in this research because 
            you meet the eligibility requirements for participation, which include being 18 years or 
            older, a fluent English speaker, and having normal or corrected-to-normal (20/20) vision. 
            About one hundred participants will take part in the study. This research is being funded 
            by the United States Air Force.

          <h2>Procedures</h2>
          <p>
            If you decide to take part, this is what will happen: you will first be asked to provide your 
            consent by clicking "I consent and continue." After giving consent, you will complete an 
            online questionnaire about your background, personality, values, moral beliefs, and 
            any potential needs or constraints relevant to a fire-rescue situation. You will then 
            engage in a simulated emergency conversation in which you will interact via text with 
            a virtual emergency operator powered by artificial intelligence; during this interaction, 
            you will take on the role of the person being rescued. You will share your preference, 
            willingness to follow the instructions and how natural the conversation felt. The entire 
            procedure should take 15 to 20 minutes. After the completion of the survey, we will request your email address solely to send you compensation. To 
            ensure data quality and anonymity, we'll compare your responses with known patterns of 
            effort. If the responses do not meet our data quality standards, compensation will not be offered.

          <h2>Risk and Discomforts</h2>
          <p>
            Participation in this study involves minimal risk. Some participants may experience mild 
            psychological discomfort or stress when engaging with the simulated fire-rescue 
            scenario, as it depicts an emergency. You may also experience minor fatigue while 
            completing the online questionnaire or interacting with the virtual operator. Although 
            your responses will be recorded anonymously, there is always a small risk of loss of 
            confidentiality, as is possible with any online data collection. No physical risks, medical 
            procedures, or in-person activities involved.

            skip or stop answering any questions you don't want to.

            There are no direct benefits to you from taking part in this study. However, your 
            participation in this study may help us better understand communication and decision-making during emergency situations, which could contribute to improved emergency 
            response systems
